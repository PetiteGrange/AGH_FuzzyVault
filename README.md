## Inspirations

### Some repos:

This is some Github repositories I read to understand how a fuzzy vault works

- Simple, python, based on original: https://github.com/jwoogerd/fuzzy_vault

- Decentralized, C/C++ : https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption

- Thesis, python, seems hard, decentralized: https://github.com/abb-iss/distributed-fuzzy-vault


### Some papers:

This is some papers I read to get familiar with the concept and algorithm

- The original: https://people.csail.mit.edu/madhu/papers/2002/ari-journ.pdf

- On implementation: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02458
